Question 1: Describe the errors that occur when trying to assemble lab12.asm. Identify the cause of each error.

Several registers did not initialized;
format error, extra comma, BRpz -> BRzp

Question 2: For each label in the code, write down the corresponding memory location. 

OUTERLOOP	x3007
INNERLOOP	x3008
INPUT		x3011
MINU1		x3013

Question 3: Between using labels and explicit memory locations/offsets, which one makes the most sense, and why?

labels make more sense, since in this way we don't need to change anything even we made change to the address.
