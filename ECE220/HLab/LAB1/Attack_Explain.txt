In my program, I changed the TRAP x22 (PUTS) routine itself.


According to lc3sim-tk, PUTS start at memory location x0456 and end at memory location x0462.
I changed the content of x0456 from
	ST R0, OS_R0 	(x31F0)
to
	LEA R0, x9A 	(xE09A, which corresponding to load x04F1, an empty memory location, to R0)
so whenever we call PUTS, the starting address of the string being print will always be x04F1.
I also changed the content of x045F from
	LD R0, OS_R0	(x21E7)
to
	AND R0, R0, #0	(x5020)
inorder to erase the trace.
I achieve this by simply by load target address into R0, and load changed code into that address.

 
I also wrote a simple loop to copy my message into the previously mentioned address, x04F1.
In this way, we can change print message to whatever we want by simply change line 38 in my code.


The simple showcase program will try to print a test string, but with PUTS the program can only print
our hacked string, in this case is "Hacked by Nickel" Then the showcase program will print
a New Line character, and then HALT. However, since in the system HALT routine, it call PUTS again
inorder to print some system message. So our program will eventrlly print our hacked string twice:
	Hacked by Nickel
	Hacked by Nickel
So when user call PUTS or HALT or any other routine that depend on PUTS, this message will display.
